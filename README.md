# HartshorneSolutions

A project to write a full set of solutions to Hartshorne's *Algebraic Geometry*.

# What's the purpose of this document?

Hartshorne puts a lot of the content of his text in the exercises.
Sometimes these exercises are pretty tough, and sometimes you'd like a nudge in the right direction or to check your work so far: that's what this document is for.
Please don't copy answers to homework out of this document or read the solutions too early on in your attempts on a problem - that's depriving yourself of the opportunity to learn.
The goal of this document is to act as an aid to learning, and the struggle with a math problem is a key part of the learning process.
If you're stuck, start by trying smaller cases, toy examples, simplifications of the problem, and things like that - once you've tried those and been stuck for a while, then it might be a good time to open this up and get a new idea.

# Structure of the document

All errors in exercises and difficulty warnings are located in the introduction - if you are wondering whether the exercise you're working on is not correctly posed, needs a good bit of extra material not mentioned in Hartshorne, or is just very difficult for whatever reason, check the introduction (chapter 0) first.
Any problem which has a non-minor issue will be listed there.

Chapters are referred to by roman numerals, sections and exercises are referred to with arabic numerals, and appendices are referred to by capital letters.

To navigate quickly to a particular exercise, search within the document for "Exercise I.2.3." - this will jump directly to exercise 3 in section 2 in chapter I.

# Material Covered

Currently this covers chapters I-IV and appendix C.
The plan is to eventually cover the whole book (hopefully).
