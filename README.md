# HartshorneSolutions

A project to write a full set of solutions to Hartshorne's *Algebraic Geometry*.

# What's the purpose of this document?

Hartshorne puts a lot of the content of his text in the exercises.
Sometimes these exercises are pretty tough, and sometimes you'd like a nudge in the right direction or to check your work so far: that's what this document is for.
Please don't copy answers to homework out of this document or read the solutions too early on in your attempts on a problem - that's depriving yourself of the opportunity to learn.
The goal of this document is to act as an aid to learning, and the struggle with a math problem is a key part of the learning process.
If you're stuck, start by trying smaller cases, toy examples, simplifications of the problem, and things like that - once you've tried those and been stuck for a while, then it might be a good time to open this up and get a new idea.

(Please don't do anything weird with this like try to pass it off as your own work or sell it or something like that. Don't be a jerk, y'know?)

# Quick navigation

If you want to jump to exercise 3 of section 2 of chapter I, you can search in the document for "Exercise I.2.3" and it will take you directly there.
For reference, chapter numbers are in roman numerals, while section and exercise numbers are in arabic numerals.

# Material Covered

Currently this covers chapters I, II, III, sections 1-3 of chapter IV, and appendix C.
The plan is to eventually cover the whole book, hopefully.
